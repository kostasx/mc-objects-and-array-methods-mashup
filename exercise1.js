// Array.prototype.map
// Research online what Array.prototype.map does!

// your version of map will take an array as the first argument, and a function
// as the second argument, returning a new array, in the same manner as
// Array.prototype.map would.

// if you want more clues on how your functions should work, look at the tests.

function map(array, fn) {
  //your code here
}

// Array.prototype.filter
// Research online what Array.prototype.filter does!

// your version of filter will take an array as the first argument, and a
// function as the second argument, returning a new array in the same manner as
// Array.prototype.filter would

function filter(array, fn) {
  //your code here
